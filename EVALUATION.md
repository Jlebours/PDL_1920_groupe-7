# Evaluation

## Installation

We had a comprehension problem with the installation of maven in the project, 
we created a new maven project within the initial project, as we had followed the creation procedure of project maven in the install.md. 
Then we refined this part and added another part to explain the installation of maven on personal computers.

## Maven test

During the mvn test run, the build is running correctly, we get 10 tests that don't work so 4 that work on the 14 test cases.
The extractor test generates 3 bugs when reading urls, caused by special characters.

The HTML extractor generates 1621 files and the WIKITEXT extractor generates 1547 files.
The test of the extractor can be generated by this command: mvn -Dtest=ConverterToCsvTest#extractor test

## JUnit test

When unit tests are launched directly on the project, the build goes smoothly, 
and we get, as for the mvn test, 10 tests that do not work so 4 that work on the 14 test cases.
- Issue on JUnit test : https://github.com/Jlebours/PDL_1920_groupe-7/issues/3

We have observed that during a new extraction, all the files are generated again, and are never identical to the previous generation.
This falsifies the majority of tests, especially the tests of VéritéTerrain which compares a stable csv file in the verite directory,
to a new csv each time an extraction is made, which will always generate errors.
