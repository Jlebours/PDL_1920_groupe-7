# PDL_1819_grp5

Extraction of tabular data from Wikipedia pages to transform them into a simpler file format so that they can be used with appropriate tools such as statistical tools and spreadsheets. 
The software is able to analyze the HTML or wikitext syntax of a given wikipedia page, or several from a dataset (set of wikipedia urls) provided. This way, the tables can be taken out of these pages and saved in CSV files.
