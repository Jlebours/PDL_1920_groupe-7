"Notes on the Java implementation: Files.readAllLines method returns a List of String, with the content of the text file, Files has also the method readAllBytes, returns a array of Strings. Files.write method writes byte array or into an output file, indicated by a Path object. Files.write method also takes care of buffering and closing the output stream.","Notes on the C# implementation: The ReadLines method returns an enumerable object that upon enumeration will read the file one line at a time. The WriteAllLines method takes an enumerable and retrieves a line at a time and writes it until the enumeration ends. The underlying reader will automatically allocate a buffer, thus there is no need to explicitly introduce a buffered stream. WriteAllLines automatically closes the output stream, also in the case of an abnormal termination."
