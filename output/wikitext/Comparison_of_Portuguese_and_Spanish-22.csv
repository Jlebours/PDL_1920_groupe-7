d,{{IPA|[d ~ ð]}},{{IPA|[d ~ ð]}} (EP) {{IPA|[d ~ dʒ]}} (BP),"In Spanish and European Portuguese {{IPA|/d/}} is lenited after a continuant. In all Portuguese dialects, the consonants {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} have affricate allophones, happening when before a palatalizing {{IPA|/i/}} ({{IPA|[{{IPA link|dʒ}}i ~ {{IPA link|dʑ}}i]}}, {{IPA|[{{IPA link|tʃ}}i ~ {{IPA link|tɕ}}i]}}, mainly in Brazil), or an elided {{IPA|/ɨ/ ~ /e̞/ ~ /ɪ/}} or unstressed {{IPA|/i/}} before another (that actually becomes {{IPA|/ɨ/}} in Portugal), stressed one, leading to sandhi ({{IPA|[dVz] → {{IPAblink|dz}}}}, {{IPA|[dVs] → {{IPAblink|ts}}}}, {{IPA|[tVs] → [ts]}}, both in Brazil and Portugal)."
t,{{IPA|[t]}},{{IPA|[t]}} (EP) {{IPA|[t ~ tʃ]}} (BP),
g,{{IPA|[ɡ ~ ɣ]}},{{IPA|[ɡ ~ ɣ]}} (EP) {{IPA|[ɡ]}} (BP),In Spanish and European Portuguese {{IPA|/ɡ/}} is lenited after a continuant.
-l,{{IPA|[l]}},{{IPA|[ɫ]}} (EP) {{IPA|[w]}} (BP),"In European Portuguese syllable-final {{IPA|/l/}} is velarized {{IPAblink|ɫ}} as in Catalan (see dark l), while in most Brazilian dialects and some rural European ones it is vocalized to {{IPAblink|w}}. Caipira rhoticizes to English-like ar, while portunhol da pampa velarizes it."
"r-, -rr-",{{IPA|[r]}},{{IPA|[ʁ]}},"In Portuguese, r- and -rr- have several possible pronunciations. In most dialects, it is a guttural r as in French ({{IPA|[ʀ]}}, {{IPA|[ʁ]}} and {{IPA|[χ]}} in Portugal and Brazil, {{IPA|[x]}}, {{IPA|[ɣ]}}, {{IPA|[ħ]}}, {{IPA|[h]}} and {{IPA|[ɦ]}} in Brazil), while in rural northern Portugal and southern Brazil it is a trilled r {{IPAblink|r}} (like in Galician). In some southern and western Brazilian dialects word final -r may be a tap (as in Portugal and Galicia), though English-like {{IPAblink|ɹ}}, {{IPAblink|ɻ}} or {{IPAblink|ɚ}} is more common, while in northern and eastern dialects it is guttural. In Spanish, r- and -rr- have kept their original pronunciation as an alveolar trill {{IPAblink|r}}. Intervocalic -r- is an alveolar tap in both languages {{IPAblink|ɾ}}."
v,{{IPA|[b ~ β]}},{{IPA|[v]}},"Originally, the letters ⟨b⟩ and ⟨v⟩ stood for distinct sounds pronounced {{IPAblink|b}} and {{IPAblink|β}}, respectively, but the two eventually merged into a single phoneme in Spanish. In most varieties of Portuguese they remained separate phonemes, and the bilabial fricative {{IPA|[β]}} of Old Portuguese subsequently changed into the labiodental fricative {{IPAblink|v}}, as in French and Italian."
